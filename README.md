### Objective
AI is everywhere....

But the successful ones are within limited areas, like image, video, text etc..., by using deep neural networks, which is using a lot computation resources, like GPU, TPU, or FPGA etc.

The thing is, whether like our human brain, the most intelligent thing in the whole world, running without such large need of computation, right?

The real AI should not need such heavy-lifting stuff. AI should be light-weight,accumalative, everywhere.

This project trying to create, or build a low level AI by integrated into computer os-level intelligence. AI should be born with the system in deep low level.

Now the question is: can we make it?
